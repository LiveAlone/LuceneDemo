Announcing that you have an open innovation program is one thing, Waldorn pointed out. But what it really all comes down to is closing the loop and getting to market. Inventors need true commitment. Are their products on the shelf? I agree. I'm extremely happy that Quirky is back and engaging in a dialgue with companies that want to embrace open innovation.

The ultimate test isn’t whether a licensing deal is secured, but rather, if there are reorders. Only time will tell.

What I really appreciate about Quirky is that it’s just as much of a learning tool as it is an opportunity to materialize your ideas. So much of what inventing is really about is being willing to keep getting up to bat -- to take your ego out of the equation and really listen. By taking away risk, Quirky has empowered everyday people to take action on their ideas. That’s something for all of us to celebrate.
